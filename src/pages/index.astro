            <cite style="max-width: 50%;">"Once, a philosopher dreamt he was a butterfly, drifting effortlessly on the wind. In his dream, he knew no care, no burden, only the joy of being. But when he awoke, he was no longer certain: was he a man who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly now dreaming he was a man?"
