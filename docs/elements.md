# Fading - Core Design Elements

### Universal Constants

- Single lamp in darkness
- Presence seeking understanding
- Hospital memory thread
- Hand in darkness motif

### Three Core Paths

Each path reinterprets these constants distinctly:

#### Unity Path

```
Light: Soft, blending, warm
Sound: Merged, harmonious
Form: Diffuse, expanding
Memory: Hand as connection
Crisis: Fear of dissolution
Resolution: Transcendence through connection
```

#### Knowledge/Agency Path

```
Light: Sharp, geometric, focused
Sound: Distinct, rhythmic
Form: Crystalline, structured
Memory: Hand as choice
Crisis: Fear of predetermination
Resolution: Understanding through reconstruction
```

#### Mystery Path

```
Light: Flowing, shifting
Sound: Echoing, layered
Form: Rippling, fluid
Memory: Hand as question
Crisis: Fear of meaninglessness
Resolution: Meaning through seeking
```

### Implementation Guide

1. Track player tendencies through:

- Dialogue choice patterns
- Response to memories
- Reaction to uncertainty

2. Provide feedback via:

- Light behavior
- Sound layering
- Form stability
- Memory clarity

3. Crisis points occur when:

- Core questions emerge
- Stability wavers
- Reality shifts
- Identity questions arise

4. Resolution achieved through:

- Philosophical consistency
- Emotional resonance
- Environmental harmony
- Memory integration

### Development Priority

1. Core interaction system
2. Environmental feedback
3. Path differentiation
4. Crisis/resolution mechanics
